name: Pre-start marker identity
description: Distinguishes the persistent startup gate from the nested legacy compatibility marker during schema-stall diagnosis.
---

The persistent startup stage uses `pre_start_schema`; the nested legacy compatibility check uses `api_pre_start_schema`. They have different lifecycle behavior and must not be treated as the same marker during reproduction or recovery. Additive runtime repair substeps that must run on every restart belong outside the persistent `pre_start_schema` callback.

**Why:** Resetting only the compatibility marker leaves the outer registry snapshot completed, so the pre-start callback is skipped and the expected substep trace never appears. A trigger refresh placed inside that callback is silently skipped on steady-state restarts.

**How to apply:** When reproducing a pre-start stall, inspect and manipulate only the `pre_start_schema` gate for the outer running/completed transition; use `api_pre_start_schema` only to test the nested legacy DDL branch. Keep independent, idempotent repair installers outside the gated callback and give them their own bounded substep/retry path.
