name: Startup readiness boundary
description: Distinguishes mirror contract installation from complete API startup readiness
---

## Rule
The canonical mirror installer can complete before the API's final readiness flag. A phase requiring startup/runtime health must require `/api/health/ready` to return `ready: true` and the startup chain completion marker, even when live function definitions and replay tests pass.

**Why:** The API listens before its long migration/seed chain finishes, so port availability and successful resolver installation do not prove the application is fully ready.

**How to apply:** Treat resolver logs, live function checks, replay results, and API readiness as separate evidence. Never certify a finalization that requires healthy startup while the readiness endpoint remains false.

## Frontend boundary
When the API listens before cold-start migrations finish, distinguish API availability from full migration readiness: use availability to decide whether the shell can render, and keep company/data providers and startup side effects behind the stronger readiness contract.

**Why:** A full-screen migration-readiness gate leaves BizPortal unusable for several minutes during the long serial migration chain, while mounting all data providers before the API is reachable can recreate the request fan-out the gate is meant to prevent.

**How to apply:** During development startup, poll `/api/health/ready` with a short timeout; render the availability/preparing state only when the API cannot be reached, and let `CompanyContext`/data side effects wait for the appropriate readiness signal. Keep production behavior unchanged unless its startup contract explicitly requires the gate.
When the API listens before cold-start migrations finish, distinguish API availability from full migration readiness. Gate only operations that require the completed schema; allow the login shell and safe auth endpoints to render once the API responds.

**Why:** The API serves safe endpoints such as auth and translations while migrations continue. Blocking the entire portal on the final readiness flag leaves users staring at a loading screen even though the server is reachable.

**How to apply:** During development startup, poll `/api/health/ready` with a short timeout, track response reachability separately from `ready: true`, and use the reachability state for the initial shell/auth boundary. Keep the full readiness state available for schema-sensitive work.
