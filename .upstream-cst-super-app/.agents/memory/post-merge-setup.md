name: Post-merge setup hook
description: The automatic merge runner requires an explicitly configured, non-interactive setup script.
---

The presence of `scripts/post-merge.sh` is not enough for automatic task-merge setup. The project must also configure the script path and a realistic timeout in the `.replit` post-merge section. The script should remain idempotent, fail fast for required work, and keep optional reports or seeds non-fatal when their guarded dependencies are unavailable.

**Why:** A merged task can fail before any setup command runs when the hook path is absent, even though a valid setup script already exists in the repository.

**How to apply:** When a post-merge hook is missing, register the existing script rather than creating a duplicate, run the setup once, then verify workflow reconciliation and API readiness. Keep production schema changes outside the automatic DEV setup path. If the managed bootstrap secret is absent, install dependencies but skip DB migrations and seed; API startup owns those operations once secrets are available.
