name: Canonical settlement legacy FK repair
description: Safe handling of invalid historical canonical-bank-mutation links during startup contract installation.
---

When installing the canonical settlement foreign key, first inspect the live
`confrelid` target and schema-qualify it. A numeric link absent from the
legacy `sport_center.bank_mutations` table may still be a valid
`public.bank_mutations` link after the public-identity cutover; never classify
those rows as missing until both identities are checked. Clear only links whose
target is absent from the authoritative table, then rebuild only posted
settlements with exactly one active payment through the canonical owner
routine. A historical batch without enough evidence remains unlinked for
governed follow-up; it must never receive an invented bank mutation.

**Why:** A stale legacy integer link can make PostgreSQL reject the new FK and leave the whole API readiness gate permanently in `starting`, even though the affected batch is not safely reconstructable.

**How to apply:** Keep the migration versioned so prior completion markers do not skip the repair. Treat an unsuccessful legacy reconstruction as a warning after the invalid link is removed, while preserving posted journals and enforcing the FK for all future writes.

An active payment item in an unlinked `posted` settlement remains unavailable to candidate generation even when its payment date, method, status, and expected settlement date are otherwise valid.

**Why:** Reusing it as a fresh candidate could double-settle a payment whose financial batch already exists, while silently deleting it could corrupt posted-ledger evidence.

**How to apply:** Diagnose the owning batch first. Either link the complete batch through governed owner recovery when its mutation identity is provable, or perform an explicit posted-settlement repair; regeneration alone must not release the payment.

Do not link an orphaned historical batch merely because its net equals one bank mutation. Revalidate every active item's payment date against the current cohort rule; a legacy batch may mix valid H-1 payments with a same-day payment that only makes the total balance.

**Why:** Exact batch net can conceal invalid membership. Linking such a batch would restore the bank foreign key while violating the current settlement contract.

**How to apply:** Compare the full active item set—not only the rows visible in the UI—against the mutation date. If any item is outside H-1, stop owner recovery and require a governed repair or a verified missing H-1 payment.
