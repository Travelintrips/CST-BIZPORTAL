description: Workspace setup and dev-database prerequisites for reconciliation validation.

For reconciliation validation, restore workspace dependencies with the frozen pnpm lockfile, then build shared TypeScript declarations before running the API typecheck. The QRIS/ERP contract tests are independent of the full dev schema, but the broader isolation tests require `accounting_entries` and `expense_rules` to exist in the development database.

**Why:** A clean workspace may have no `node_modules`, and the API typecheck otherwise reports declaration-output errors. The isolation assertions fail when the development database is missing baseline tables, even when the matcher changes are correct.

**How to apply:** Run dependency restore, shared-library typecheck, API typecheck, and target QRIS/ERP tests first. When the isolated test URL is stored in GCP, invoke the official development Secret Manager loader before Vitest; a direct shell may appear unconfigured. If a full frozen restore is blocked by an unrelated package-firewall/codegen tarball, restore the directly required frontend and API workspace filters from the local store without changing the lockfile. Treat missing baseline tables as a dev-schema prerequisite rather than as a QRIS/ERP regression.
