name: QRIS UI evidence boundary
description: The bank-reconciliation QRIS badge can come from a matched source payment, not from the bank mutation narrative itself.
---

On the generic bank-mutation card, `Rekening Bank` and `Jenis payment: QRIS` can appear together: the source label uses bank evidence, while the payment badge uses the best persisted candidate's payment type. A stale or cross-environment match can therefore make an ordinary transfer look like QRIS.

**Why:** Reviewer-facing labels must not be interpreted as one unified classifier; diagnosing a false QRIS display requires checking both the mutation evidence and the source candidate/match state in the same runtime database.

**How to apply:** First verify `provider_name`, description evidence, and active match rows for the exact mutation; then compare the candidate's current payment method/provider and environment before changing classification data. Never render or approve a QRIS snapshot unless the bank rail is QRIS and every live snapshot payment is still QRIS; retired snapshots are audit history only.

Persisted QRIS candidates without a batch audit remain reviewer evidence on the generic bank-mutation card, but must stay read-only there; the generic checkbox/approval flow is only for non-QRIS candidates.

**Why:** Hiding the candidate makes an already matched/approved mutation look unexplained, while enabling the generic approval path would bypass QRIS settlement governance.

**How to apply:** Render the candidate on the card when it is present and valid for the review date; label approved candidates as already used and keep selection disabled for QRIS or finalized mutation states.

Canonical settlement detail resolution has two read states: pending `posted` + unlinked for approval candidates, and finalized `approved` + `reconciled` + exact bank-mutation link for read-only evidence. Reusing only the pending eligibility predicate makes approved candidates lose `details`, so the UI date gate hides them.

**Why:** The production settlement source transitions to `reconciled` and stores its bank mutation link after approval; that is valid evidence, not a second approval opportunity.

**How to apply:** Keep approval eligibility strict, but let the display resolver load finalized details only when the approved match and canonical batch point to the same mutation.

The QRIS review endpoint defaults to `MATCHED` for approval-oriented callers; the review dashboard must explicitly request all review states so `REVIEW` and `UNMATCHED` evidence remains visible without becoming approvable.

**Why:** A dashboard that used the endpoint default showed only generic bank-transfer matches and hid the QRIS candidates whose amount/provider evidence still needed review.

**How to apply:** Use an explicit all-status review query for the QRIS evidence panel, while retaining strict `MATCHED` plus live-evidence checks for the approval action.
