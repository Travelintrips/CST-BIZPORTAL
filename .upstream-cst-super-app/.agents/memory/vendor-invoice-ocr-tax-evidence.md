Vendor invoice OCR must preserve printed component values and PPh evidence across all document pages. For PDFs with a text layer, pair extracted text with rendered page images because table column order can be flattened. A PPh rate plus an unambiguous component DPP/NET and GROSS may produce a clearly labeled calculated estimate for withholding and payable-to-vendor; a rate without a reliable base must remain null.

For Indonesian invoices using DPP Nilai Lain, the OCR header can incorrectly map the commercial component total into both subtotal and total while leaving PPN at zero, even when the structured breakdown contains explicit PPN. Recover PPN only when every component gross value reconciles to that commercial total; the accounting net remains the component/commercial total and the payable gross is net plus explicit PPN. Do not use breakdown DPP + PPN as the accounting gross unless the source explicitly supports that relationship.

**Why:** Deriving a payment amount from a rate can create an incorrect posted liability or WhatsApp payment instruction, especially when the tax base or tax treatment differs from the visible component. Explicit printed amounts remain stronger evidence than a calculation, and the calculation must not be mistaken for an official withholding certificate.

**How to apply:** Store the structured OCR breakdown as supporting evidence, use visual page layout to associate table columns, calculate per component from NET/DPP × printed rate and GROSS − calculated PPh only when all inputs are clear, and keep tax review required before posting or treating the result as an official proof-of-withholding. If page rendering is unavailable, retain a controlled text-only fallback and flag uncertain table associations.
