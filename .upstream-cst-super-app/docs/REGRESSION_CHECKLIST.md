# Regression Checklist

> Run this checklist after any significant change to validate that Critical, High, and Medium fixes remain intact.

---

## 1. Price Sync

| # | Test | Expected | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Admin updates product price in BizPortal | Customer Portal updates within ~1 second (SSE `price_sync`) | |
| 1.2 | Vendor submits `vendorPrice` via RFQ form | `finalPrice = vendorPrice × (1 + markup%)` computed correctly | |
| 1.3 | Admin sets override `sellingPrice` on approve | Uses override value, not auto-computed markup | |
| 1.4 | VMF vendor submits price | `customer_approvals.sellingPrice` reflects correct margin | |
| 1.5 | Price revision (resubmit_allowed) | Previous price saved in `vendor_price_history`; new price active | |

---

## 2. Order Lifecycle

| # | Test | Expected | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Customer submits order | `logistic_orders.status = "New Order"` | |
| 2.2 | Admin creates RFQ | `logistic_order_rfqs` record created; status → `"Under Review"` | |
| 2.3 | Vendor accepts via token | `quoteStatus = "vendor_confirmed"`; order → `"Vendor Confirmed"` | |
| 2.4 | Vendor rejects | `quoteStatus = "vendor_rejected"`; admin re-blast available | |
| 2.5 | Admin approves quote | `logistic_orders.status = "Quotation Sent"`; `customerConfirmToken` set | |
| 2.6 | Customer confirms | `status = "Customer Approved"`; `customerConfirmStatus = "confirmed"` | |
| 2.7 | Customer rejects | Status stays `"Quotation Sent"`; `customerConfirmStatus = "rejected"` | |
| 2.8 | Duplicate customer confirm | 409 Conflict — `customerConfirmStatus !== "pending"` guard fires | |
| 2.9 | Driver status update | `driver_jobs` status advances per `VALID_TRANSITIONS` map | |
| 2.10 | Invalid driver transition | 400 with `allowedTransitions` in response | |
| 2.11 | POD submitted | `driver_jobs.status = "DELIVERED"`; `podReceiverName` set | |

| 3.4 | Vendor using admin-only VMF link | 404 Not Found (`formTarget` mismatch) | |

| 3.8 | Private file access without auth | 401 Unauthorized | |

| 4.3 | Duplicate send within dedup window | `status = "deduped"` in `notification_logs`; no second WA | |
| 4.4 | FONNTE_TOKEN invalid | `status = "failed"` logged; main flow continues (no crash) | |
| 4.5 | Quotation sent → customer WA | Customer receives WA with confirm URL | |
| 4.6 | Customer confirms → admin WA | Admin receives WA with SO number if created | |
| 4.7 | Delivery completed → customer WA | Customer receives delivery notification | |
