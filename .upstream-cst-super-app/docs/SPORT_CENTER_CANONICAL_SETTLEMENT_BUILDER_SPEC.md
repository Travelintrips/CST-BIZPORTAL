# Phase 4C-7A.7F — Canonical Sport Center Settlement Builder

**Status:** SPECIFICATION ONLY — no implementation  
**Scope:** Define the minimum contract for a future canonical settlement builder.  
**Out of scope:** 4C-8, reconciliation approval, void/reopen, generic `/post`,
bank mutations, Google Sheet ingestion, and manual settlement-row writes.

## 1. Current evidence and ownership boundary

The canonical tables already exist in the `sport_center` schema:

```text
sport_center.sport_payments
sport_center.payment_settlement_configs
sport_center.payment_settlement_items
sport_center.payment_settlement_batches
sport_center.accounting_journals
```

The canonical read-only bank candidate function is:

```text
sport_center.find_settlement_bank_candidates(bigint, integer)
```

It is a finder only. It does not create payment settlement items, batches, or
journals.

The existing checked-in application contains:

- a canonical settlement read adapter;
- canonical settlement approval/link-only logic;
- a generic public QRIS settlement engine;
- a settlement-pattern recognition engine;
- the existing application accounting posting engine.

None of those is the canonical Sport Center payment-settlement builder.
The generic QRIS engine must not be reused for `sport_center.*` settlement
creation, and the settlement-pattern engine is not a posting engine.

The frozen database evidence for a known canonical settlement demonstrates the
target journal shape:

```text
reference: TEST-SETTLEMENT-20260810-001
gross:     100000.00
MDR:          300.00
net:       99700.00

DR 99700.00  Bank Net
DR   300.00  MDR / provider deductions
CR 100000.00 Payment Clearing Gross
```

That row is evidence of the canonical data contract, not permission to copy
its values or manually create another settlement.

### 1.1 Mandatory implementation gates

The builder may not be implemented until all of the following are proven from
the live development schema or from an owner-approved canonical service
contract:

1. The exact bridge from a confirmed canonical payment to its **posted payment
   journal** is identified.
2. The exact owner of `sport_center.accounting_journals` settlement journal
   creation and posting is identified.
3. The exact payment `settlement_status` transition owned by the canonical
   schema is identified.
4. The exact fee/rate columns in `payment_settlement_configs` are identified.
5. The exact uniqueness/index contract for settlement-batch grouping is
   verified.

If any gate is missing, the builder must fail closed and no settlement write
may occur. This document does not create a replacement function or service to
resolve those gates.

## 2. Canonical source and eligibility

The builder operates only on canonical rows from:

```text
sport_center.sport_payments
```

An input payment is eligible only when all conditions hold in the same
transaction:

```text
payment.status = 'confirmed'
payment.company_id IS NOT NULL
payment.provider identity is complete
payment.external bank account identity is complete
payment.expected_settlement_date IS NOT NULL
payment.settlement_rule_version IS NOT NULL
payment.settlement_status = 'unsettled'
owner-approved settlement config matches the payment
payment accounting journal exists and is posted
payment is not already in an active settlement item
```

The payment-to-journal relationship must be resolved through the verified
canonical bridge. The implementation must not infer a journal from:

- a public mirror payment ID;
- a payment number alone;
- a journal with a matching amount;
- an unrelated public `accounting_entries` row;
- a generic journal-reuse lookup.

The payment journal must be locked and revalidated as `posted` before the
settlement item is inserted.

The active-item exclusion is:

```sql
NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM sport_center.payment_settlement_items item
  WHERE item.payment_id = payment.id
    AND item.item_status = 'active'
)
```

The database unique partial index on active `payment_id` remains authoritative.
The pre-check is advisory only.

## 3. Owner-approved configuration

Configuration is read only from:

```text
sport_center.payment_settlement_configs
```

The selected row must satisfy:

```text
company_id = payment.company_id
provider_code = normalized payment provider
bank_account_id = payment external bank-account identity
is_active = true
source = 'OWNER_APPROVED'
rule_version = payment.settlement_rule_version
effective_from <= payment settlement date
effective_until IS NULL OR payment settlement date < effective_until
```

For the known development configuration, the resolved identity is:

```text
company:  1
provider: mandiri_direct
bank:     1640006707220
rule:     PROD-MANDIRI-SC-20260810-v1
window:   T+1 business day
MDR:      0.003
fee:      0
fee tax:  0
```

These values are configuration evidence, not recovery constants. The builder
must read the effective configuration row for each payment group. It must not
derive MDR, fees, or net amounts from a bank mutation.

The implementation must identify the exact live configuration columns for:

```text
MDR rate or MDR amount rule
provider fee amount/rate
fee-tax amount/rate
adjustment policy
```

If those columns cannot be resolved unambiguously, return a controlled
configuration error and roll back.

## 4. Grouping key

Eligible payments are grouped only by this complete key:

```text
company_id
provider identity
external bank account
expected_settlement_date
settlement_rule_version
```

Provider identity includes the normalized provider code and the provider
identity required by the canonical schema. A provider name alone is not a
stable grouping key.

Payments with different values in any grouping dimension must never share a
batch. In particular, the builder must not mix:

- different companies;
- different providers;
- different external bank accounts;
- different settlement dates;
- different owner-approved rule versions.

The settlement reference and correlation identity must be deterministic from
the complete grouping key. It must not depend on process time, row order, or a
random value.

## 5. Batch calculation

For each locked group:

```text
gross_amount =
  SUM(payment.amount for eligible payments in the group)

mdr_amount =
  owner-approved MDR calculation for the group

provider_fee_amount =
  owner-approved provider-fee calculation for the group

fee_tax_amount =
  owner-approved fee-tax calculation for the group

tax_withheld_amount =
  owner-approved withholding calculation, otherwise 0

adjustment_amount =
  explicit approved adjustment only, otherwise 0

net_amount =
  gross_amount
  - mdr_amount
  - provider_fee_amount
  - fee_tax_amount
  - tax_withheld_amount
  + adjustment_amount
```

All amounts are rounded using the canonical database/accounting precision
before constraint validation. The result must satisfy the existing batch
checks:

```text
all component amounts >= 0
net_amount >= 0
net_amount equals the formula above
```

The builder must never use:

```text
bank mutation amount
bank mutation MDR/deduction
observed bank credit
generic QRIS candidate amount
hardcoded recovery values
```

## 6. Settlement item contract

For every eligible payment in a group, insert exactly one active item with:

```text
settlement_id
payment_id
payment_journal_id
gross_amount = payment.amount
item_status = 'active'
source_event_id when supplied by the canonical event contract
correlation_id = deterministic builder correlation
created_by
```

The item must satisfy the existing constraints:

```text
gross_amount > 0
item_status IN ('active', 'reversed', 'voided')
payment_id references sport_center.sport_payments
payment_journal_id references sport_center.accounting_journals
settlement_id references payment_settlement_batches
```

The active uniqueness invariants are:

```text
UNIQUE (payment_id) WHERE item_status = 'active'
UNIQUE (payment_journal_id) WHERE item_status = 'active'
UNIQUE (source_event_id) WHERE source_event_id IS NOT NULL
UNIQUE (correlation_id) WHERE correlation_id IS NOT NULL
```

The builder must treat a unique violation as a concurrency/idempotency
decision, not as success. It must re-read the locked canonical state and
return either the already-built result or a controlled conflict.

## 7. Batch lifecycle

The builder owns only the accounting settlement lifecycle:

```text
draft
  -> calculated
  -> posted
```

It must not set a batch to `reconciled`, attach a bank mutation, or invoke
reconciliation approval.

Required batch fields:

```text
company_id
provider_code
provider_name
bank_account_id
settlement_date
gross_amount
mdr_amount
provider_fee_amount
fee_tax_amount
tax_withheld_amount
adjustment_amount
net_amount
settlement_rule_version
source = 'SPORT_CENTER'
correlation_id
bank_mutation_id = NULL
```

`bank_mutation_id` must remain `NULL` for the entire builder transaction.

The batch may not be marked `posted` until a valid posted settlement journal
exists and points back to the same batch.

## 8. Settlement journal contract

The settlement journal must be created in the canonical
`sport_center.accounting_journals` owner system, not in the public generic
QRIS tables and not through generic bank reconciliation posting.

Required journal properties:

```text
journal_type = 'settlement'
is_reversal = false
status = 'posted' after successful builder completion
settlement_batch_id = batch.id
gross_amount = batch.gross_amount
```

Required conceptual lines:

```text
DR Bank Net                         batch.net_amount
DR MDR / provider deductions       batch.mdr_amount
DR provider fees                   batch.provider_fee_amount
DR fee tax                         batch.fee_tax_amount
DR tax withheld receivable         batch.tax_withheld_amount, when applicable
DR/CR approved adjustment          batch.adjustment_amount, when applicable
CR Payment Clearing Gross          batch.gross_amount
```

The canonical journal owner must balance the lines and enforce its own COA
mapping. The builder must not insert raw journal lines into a second accounting
model.

The existing public application posting engine inserts public
`accounting_entries` in a draft-first flow and its public journal type contract
does not by itself establish ownership of the canonical
`sport_center.accounting_journals` settlement journal. Therefore an
implementation must use a verified canonical Sport Center journal service or
database function. If no such owner contract is found, implementation is
blocked.

## 9. Exact transaction sequence

The future builder must run as one database transaction:

```text
BEGIN

1. Resolve the canonical event/payment identity.
2. Lock eligible canonical payments in ascending payment_id order.
3. Re-read payment metadata, status, settlement status, and grouping fields.
4. Resolve and lock the single owner-approved config for each group.
5. Resolve and lock each payment's canonical posted payment journal.
6. Revalidate the active-settlement-item exclusion.
7. Acquire the deterministic group lock / batch identity lock.
8. Re-read an existing deterministic batch, if any.
9. If an existing posted batch and item set exactly match the group:
     return idempotent success without new writes.
10. If an existing batch is partial, draft, or calculated:
     lock it and resume only if all invariant checks pass.
11. Otherwise create one draft batch.
12. Insert exactly one active item per eligible payment.
13. Recalculate gross, deductions, adjustment, and net from locked sources.
14. Mark the batch calculated.
15. Create or reuse exactly one canonical settlement journal.
16. Post the settlement journal through its verified owner.
17. Re-read and verify the journal is posted, balanced, non-reversal,
    settlement-typed, and linked to this batch.
18. Mark the batch posted.
19. Apply the verified canonical payment settlement-status transition.
20. Verify bank_mutation_id remains NULL.
21. COMMIT
```

Any failure rolls back the complete transaction. A builder must not catch a
write failure and report success.

## 10. Idempotency and concurrency

Idempotency is based on canonical identity, not on a timestamp:

```text
source payment identity
event identity, when present
complete grouping key
deterministic batch correlation_id
```

Two concurrent runs for the same payment set must produce:

```text
one active item per payment
one batch for the complete grouping key
one settlement journal for that batch
one posted batch
```

Required locking order:

```text
1. canonical payments, ascending payment_id
2. owner-approved config rows
3. deterministic group/batch identity
4. existing batch, when present
5. payment journals, ascending journal ID
```

The implementation must verify these protections in the live schema before
coding:

```text
active payment_id uniqueness
active payment_journal_id uniqueness
source_event_id uniqueness
item correlation_id uniqueness
batch correlation/group uniqueness
journal-to-batch uniqueness
```

If a batch-group uniqueness constraint is absent, the implementation requires
an additive schema change or an equivalent proven database advisory-lock
contract. A pre-check without a unique/concurrency backstop is insufficient.

## 11. Payment settlement-status transition

The current canonical payment table exposes a text
`settlement_status` with a default of `unsettled`. The builder must not guess
the post-build value from the public QRIS implementation.

### 11.1 Frozen audit result — status contract remains unresolved

```text
live canonical values observed:
  sport_center.sport_payments.settlement_status = unsettled

live canonical writers observed:
  sport_center.mirror_confirmed_payment_to_public()
    copies the canonical value to public.sport_payments;
  sport_center.create_settlement_journal_draft(...)
    creates the settlement journal draft;
  sport_center.finalize_payment_settlement(...)
    finalizes the settlement journal and changes the batch to posted.

none of the verified settlement-owner functions changes
sport_center.sport_payments.settlement_status after successful settlement posting.
```

The mirror trigger is not a settlement-status owner. The public QRIS and admin
payment routes write public `sport_payments` lifecycle values, but belong to a
different public/reconciliation lifecycle and cannot establish the canonical
Sport Center transition.

Therefore the exact canonical transition is **NOT FROZEN**:

```text
unsettled -> <state not defined by the verified canonical owner contract>
```

The builder must not select `settled`, `posted`, `settlement_confirmed`, or any
other value by convention.

### 11.2 Minimum owner contract required before implementation

The canonical settlement owner must expose one transaction-scoped operation
(database function or owner service) that:

1. locks each canonical payment in ascending `payment_id` order;
2. revalidates the old value is exactly `unsettled`;
3. verifies the payment belongs to the same finalized settlement batch;
4. applies one explicitly named success state;
5. rejects an already transitioned payment unless it is an exact idempotent
   retry for the same batch;
6. returns or permits verification of the resulting state before commit.

That owner contract must also state whether the transition is applied before or
after batch finalization and must be the sole writer for this settlement
lifecycle. Until it exists, a builder run must return
`CANONICAL_PAYMENT_SETTLEMENT_STATE_UNRESOLVED` and roll back.

This is a missing owner contract, not permission to add a direct update in the
builder.

## 11A. Settlement grouping identity and concurrency freeze

### 11A.1 Deterministic group identity

The canonical group identity is the complete normalized tuple:

```text
company_id
provider identity
external bank account
expected_settlement_date
settlement_rule_version
```

For the currently verified batch columns, the persisted components are:

```text
company_id
provider_code       -- normalized provider identity
bank_account_id     -- external bank-account identity
settlement_date     -- expected settlement date
settlement_rule_version
```

`provider_name`, row order, payment IDs, process time, and bank-mutation
evidence are not substitutes for this identity. The builder must reject a group
with any missing component.

No existing field is sufficient as the group key by itself:

- `settlement_reference` is required and has a unique
  `(company_id, provider_code, settlement_reference)` index, but is currently
  caller-supplied and is not constrained to encode the complete group;
- `correlation_id` has a partial unique index, but is nullable and likewise is
  not constrained to encode the complete group;
- `provider_batch_id` is nullable and its existing unique index omits bank
  account, settlement date, and rule version;
- the existing `(company_id, bank_account_id, settlement_date)` index is
  non-unique and omits provider and rule version.

The minimum deterministic reference contract is therefore:

```text
canonical_serialization =
  versioned, length-delimited UTF-8 serialization of:
    company_id
    normalized provider identity
    external bank account
    expected settlement date
    settlement rule version

group_digest =
  lowercase hex SHA-256(canonical_serialization)

settlement_reference =
  SCB1-<group_digest>

correlation_id =
  scb:v1:<group_digest>
```

The exact serialization and normalization rules must be shared by every
builder caller. The digest must not include payment row order, a timestamp,
randomness, bank mutation data, or mutable display names. The reference and
correlation are generated by the canonical builder/owner, not accepted as
independent caller identity.

### 11A.2 Required uniqueness backstop

The live schema currently proves only:

```text
unique correlation_id WHERE correlation_id IS NOT NULL
unique (company_id, provider_code, settlement_reference)
```

Those constraints are useful idempotency backstops only after the deterministic
identity contract above is enforced. They do not prevent two callers from
choosing two different references for the same group.

The minimum schema-level grouping backstop required before implementation is a
unique index over the complete persisted group identity:

```sql
(
  company_id,
  provider_code,
  bank_account_id,
  settlement_date,
  settlement_rule_version
)
```

with the canonical active-batch lifecycle defined explicitly. At minimum,
active states must cover `draft`, `calculated`, and `posted`; if
`reconciled` remains the same canonical batch identity, it must be covered as
well. Reversed/voided replacement behavior must be specified before excluding
those states from a partial index. A non-unique lookup index or an application
pre-check is insufficient.

The frozen replacement policy is:

- `draft`, `calculated`, `posted`, and `reconciled` are one active canonical
  group identity; a new batch for the same group is a conflict, not a
  replacement;
- `reversed` and `voided` are terminal historical states; after all their
  active items are transitioned out of `active`, a new batch for the same
  group may be created;
- a reversed/voided batch must never be reused as an idempotent result, and
  its historical reference/correlation remains immutable.

The required index is **ABSENT** in the original audit snapshot and is now
installed by the additive canonical settlement migration. The current
`finalize_payment_settlement` advisory lock is keyed by an existing settlement
ID, so it serializes finalization of one batch but cannot serialize creation of
two batches for the same group. The existing correlation/reference indexes
cannot repair that gap when callers use different values.

### 11A.3 Exact concurrency and idempotency invariant

For one complete grouping key and one locked eligible payment set:

```text
two concurrent builder runs
  -> one active canonical batch
  -> one active item per payment
  -> one canonical settlement journal for that batch
  -> one posted batch
```

The builder must acquire the group identity lock or rely on the required
unique index before creating a batch. A unique violation must be re-read as an
idempotency/concurrency outcome:

- return the existing result only when the complete group, item set, journal,
  amounts, and lifecycle state match exactly;
- otherwise return `CANONICAL_SETTLEMENT_CONCURRENCY_CONFLICT` or
  `CANONICAL_SETTLEMENT_IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` and roll back.

The additive migration enforces the one-batch-per-complete-group invariant
with the partial unique index
`payment_settlement_batches_active_group_unique`, while the canonical batch
owner also takes a deterministic advisory lock before the unique-index
attempt. The grouping/concurrency gate is satisfied only after the migration
and its development runtime proof succeed.

## 12. Recovery and error codes

A failed run must be retryable:

- no partial posted batch without a valid posted journal;
- no item remains active unless it belongs to a valid resumable batch;
- no payment is marked successfully settled before the batch and journal are
  valid;
- no bank mutation or reconciliation row is changed;
- a retry must reuse the deterministic identity and existing valid rows.

Minimum controlled errors:

```text
CANONICAL_PAYMENT_NOT_ELIGIBLE
CANONICAL_PAYMENT_JOURNAL_NOT_POSTED
CANONICAL_PAYMENT_JOURNAL_BRIDGE_UNRESOLVED
CANONICAL_SETTLEMENT_CONFIG_UNRESOLVED
CANONICAL_SETTLEMENT_CONFIG_AMBIGUOUS
CANONICAL_SETTLEMENT_GROUP_INVALID
CANONICAL_SETTLEMENT_ITEM_ALREADY_ACTIVE
CANONICAL_SETTLEMENT_BATCH_CONFLICT
CANONICAL_SETTLEMENT_JOURNAL_OWNER_UNRESOLVED
CANONICAL_SETTLEMENT_JOURNAL_NOT_POSTED
CANONICAL_SETTLEMENT_JOURNAL_NOT_BALANCED
CANONICAL_PAYMENT_SETTLEMENT_STATE_UNRESOLVED
CANONICAL_SETTLEMENT_IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT
CANONICAL_SETTLEMENT_CONCURRENCY_CONFLICT
```

## 13. Explicitly forbidden operations

The builder must never:

```text
insert into public.qris_settlements
insert into public.qris_settlement_items
use generic /api/bank-reconciliation/:mutationId/post
create a reconciliation match
change sport_center.bank_mutations
set bank_mutation_id
approve a canonical bank link
reconcile a settlement
void or reopen a settlement
create a reversal
manually force payment 22
manually force SC-0001
hardcode payment 22 amounts or configuration values
```

## 14. Proposed implementation surface

Only after the mandatory implementation gates are proven:

```text
artifacts/api-server/src/lib/reconciliation/
  canonicalSettlementBuilder.ts
```

Proposed contract:

```ts
export interface CanonicalSettlementBuildOptions {
  sourcePaymentId?: number;
  sourceEventId?: string;
  actor: string;
}

export interface CanonicalSettlementBuildResult {
  ok: true;
  idempotent: boolean;
  batchIds: number[];
  itemIds: number[];
  journalIds: number[];
}

export async function buildCanonicalSportCenterSettlements(
  options: CanonicalSettlementBuildOptions,
): Promise<CanonicalSettlementBuildResult>;
```

This is a proposal for the future application boundary only. It is not an
implementation, and it must call only the verified canonical journal owner.

## 15. Required test matrix

Focused tests must prove:

1. confirmed payment with posted payment journal is eligible;
2. unconfirmed payment is rejected;
3. incomplete metadata is rejected;
4. non-owner-approved or ambiguous config is rejected;
5. non-posted payment journal is rejected;
6. unsettled payment already in an active item is rejected/idempotently
   recognized;
7. different grouping keys create separate batches;
8. same grouping key reuses one batch;
9. gross equals the sum of eligible payment gross values;
10. MDR and fees come from owner-approved config, not bank evidence;
11. net satisfies the canonical formula;
12. one item is created per eligible payment;
13. item payment journal ID is the verified posted payment journal;
14. settlement journal has the required type, link, balance, and lines;
15. batch cannot become posted before the journal is posted;
16. bank mutation remains untouched and `bank_mutation_id` remains `NULL`;
17. payment status uses the verified canonical transition;
18. repeated execution is idempotent;
19. concurrent execution yields one batch, one journal, and one active item
    per payment;
20. journal failure rolls back batch, items, and payment-state changes;
21. partial resumable state is either safely resumed or rejected with no false
    success;
22. unrelated `SC-0001` remains unchanged;
23. no generic QRIS or `/post` path is called.

Runtime proof must use isolated development fixtures only. Payment 22 and
`SC-0001` are observation/protection references, not write targets for this
spec-only phase.

## 16. Implementation readiness verdict

The status/grouping gates for this phase are now frozen. The future settlement
builder remains separately gated by the following implementation contracts:

```text
canonical payment -> posted payment journal bridge
canonical settlement journal creation/posting owner
exact owner-approved fee/rate columns
```

The additive contract migration owns the status transition and grouping
backstop, but does not create the future builder or settlement rows.

## 17. Phase 4C-7A.7H final verdict

```text
4C-7A.7H COMPLETE — STATUS/GROUPING CONTRACT FROZEN
```

Frozen owners/backstops:

- `sport_center.mark_settlement_payments_settled(bigint,text)` owns the
  transaction-scoped `unsettled -> settled` transition after a posted batch
  and posted settlement journal are verified;
- `sport_center.finalize_payment_settlement(bigint,text)` remains the
  batch/journal finalization owner and invokes the payment-state owner;
- `sport_center.payment_settlement_batches_active_group_unique` plus the
  deterministic group advisory lock enforce one active batch per complete
  grouping key;
- `reversed`/`voided` batches are historical and replaceable only after their
  active items are no longer active.
